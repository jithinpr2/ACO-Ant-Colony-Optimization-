# Simple Implemention of solving TSP problem using ACO in Python.

This version of ACO is implemented in Python, and is not designed for feature selection problem as the JAVA version. This can be termed as my intial learning playground for python programming.

Instruction to execute :

Run anttsp <number_of_cities>

example : python anttsp.py 30

Data for TSP is stored in TSP_DATAFILE

by default the number of cities is 100
